XLR to T-568B RJ45 ethernet cable:

Pin	Function	T-586B
1: 	N/C 		WHT/ORN
2: 	N/C		ORN
3: 	X-		WHT/GRN
4: 	Z+	 	BLU
5: 	Z-	 	WHT/BLU
6: 	X+	 	GRN
7: 	Y- 		WHT/BRN
8: 	Y+ 		BRN

Each pair also has 4 turns on a small ferrite toroid. The XLR drain
pins are N/C.  The box is not connected to anything.  (Not sure why I
didn't connect the drain pins, or at least one of them).  The shield
contacts on the RJ45 are connected to the box, but this has no effect
with unshielded UTP.
