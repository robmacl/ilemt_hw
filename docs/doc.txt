This file documents important bits current state of understanding
about the ILEMT implementation.  So this differs from notebook.txt
which is chronological, and contains lots of irrelevant and obsolete
material.  I'll probably move this into the github wiki.


LTC25xx ADCs:

I don't know to what degree the LTC2512 is simply a crippled version
of the LTC2500, but it seems that it is genuinely optimized for higher
output rates (lower decimation).  Not only is the output data width
reduced to 24 bits, the sampling rate increases from 1 MSPS to 1.6
MSPS.  At the max sample rate (for each) the noise specs are similar.
So probably the frontend is the same, but the data paths have reduced
width, and the SAR takes fewer cycles.

wrt. this architecture, I am a little puzzled what the benefit is of
decimating from a SAR with many noise bits, vs. only having a few
noise bits.  Maybe there is better linearity, especially at very high
decimation?  But in any case, with the LTC2500-32, in my (limited) ADC
evaluation, I had better luck getting a wide dynamic range from peak
to noise floor in the presence of signal (in comparison to audio
ADCs).  The noise floor rise I saw with signal may be due to reference
noise, but the audio parts do not have an external reference input
(which is a problem for other reasons).

In LTC SAR ADC application info there is discussion of how the ADC
driver and input caps at input affect settling of the input during the
ADC sample period.  This does not apply in any straightforward way to
our use on an AC signal.  See notebook [26 Feb 20], [3 Dec 19], but
the signal slews ~50k LSB between conversions (with 32 bit ADC), so
can never "settle".

to do certain tasks.

Levels, etc:

The present theory re. output levels is that the overall gain from digital
code to coil voltage should be the same across channels, and also this level
should be set by thermal limits (and near DAC full scale).  Turn off high
carriers and then measure voltage at coil as 1.15 V RMS (with 0.05 peak low
carrier amplitude).  See [26 Sep 19]

I have been setting the UR44 DAW output levels at -6 dB, but with
drivers set for this level the PCM1794A board doesn't have enough
output.  So you have to readjust the gain pot on the driver board when
you switch between.  To switch, you can just set the current readback
to 3.275 A.

Standardize noise floor measurements with carrier at -4 dBFS at 120mm.
Set the X-X gain to get the -4 dB, then switch to the sensor loopback
cable with HP353A attenuator to set all the gains equal.  Use the raw
data time domain RMS because the spectral measurements are iffy due to
unsynch issues.

To minimize unsynch errors in spectral measurement, set spectrum controls to
flat-top order 1 blocking 2 averaging 0, and then show the levels for "Trace
display", not "Carrier levels" (which uses fixed FFT parameters).

Because of time skew issues you really need to evaluate the test box
in "TCP only" mode, otherwise you get gratuitous LF noise, wrong
spectral peaks, etc.  This means you have to use "X X no-sense" mode,
and re-calibrate the distance (which is different than in vector
mode).  I am going to test the UR44 in this same mode for a
head-to-head comparison.  The noise is somewhat lower in vector mode
because of averaging across carriers.

With UR44, set the YZ carriers to zero.  This better matches what "TCP
only" mode is doing (and doesn't include any source channel
interaction effects that might exist, but are not there in TCP only
mode).
