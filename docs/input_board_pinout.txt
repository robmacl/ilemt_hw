Digital supply:
+5V		At least 2 pins, used to derive +3.3V
                for ADC VCCIO, LVDS drivers and receivers.

Low speed digital:
SYNC		3.3V CMOS, bussed, conversion SYNC signal to all ADCs
SCL		I2C bus for config memory, bussed
SDA
CARDSELA	Lines used to identify card and/or select config
CARDSELB	memory for card vs. probe, details TBD.  I2C mux, etc.
CARDSELC	Routed individually and/or strapped to fixed values.

Analog supplies:
+15V		Analog supplies, at least 2 pins each.  ADC +2.5
-15V		supply might be regulated down from +15V.  Or route
                separate filtered +5V supply here?

Built In Self Test:
BIST++		Test voltages that can be directed into the analog 
BIST+-		inputs, bussed.  Normally the BIST?+ lines
BIST-+		are < -10V and the BIST?- lines are > +10V, which
BIST--		turns off BIST injection.

Analog reference voltage:
REF+		10V differential, bussed

sum([8 4 2 2 6 4 4 2]) = 32

If we allow 50% grounds, then that is 64, which would be the full
connector.  But we don't need quite that many grounds, for eg. BIST,
REF, low speed digital.  May want 2 or more chassis ground pins at the
front of the connector.
